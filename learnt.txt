⚠️ Note on Gmail and others:
Gmail usually requires the From address to match the authenticated user unless you're using a custom domain with proper SPF/DKIM setup.

Some providers will reject emails or put them in spam if From address doesn't match the authenticated email account.

✅ TL;DR:
Property	Purpose	Can differ?
spring.mail.username	SMTP auth username	✅ Yes
application.mail.email-system	Logical/system “from” address	✅ Yes (if allowed by SMTP provider)
Let me know which SMTP provider you're using (Gmail, SendGrid, Mailgun, etc.) and I’ll give you more specific advice!

Implementing Resiliance4j CircuitBreaker
*************************************
 use @CircuitBreaker with Resilience4j:

@Service
public class UserService {

    @Autowired
    private NotificationRestClient notificationRestClient;

    @CircuitBreaker(name = "notificationService", fallbackMethod = "fallbackSendNotification")
    public void registerUser(UserDTO user) {
        notificationRestClient.sendNotification(user.toNotificationRequest());
    }

    public void fallbackSendNotification(UserDTO user, Throwable t) {
        // Handle fallback logic
        log.warn("Notification service failed. Reason: {}", t.getMessage());
    }
}
And configure in application.yml:


resilience4j.circuitbreaker:
  instances:
    notificationService:
      registerHealthIndicator: true
      slidingWindowSize: 5
      failureRateThreshold: 50
      waitDurationInOpenState: 10s
