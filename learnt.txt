⚠️ Note on Gmail and others:
Gmail usually requires the From address to match the authenticated user unless you're using a custom domain with proper SPF/DKIM setup.

Some providers will reject emails or put them in spam if From address doesn't match the authenticated email account.

✅ TL;DR:
Property	Purpose	Can differ?
spring.mail.username	SMTP auth username	✅ Yes
application.mail.email-system	Logical/system “from” address	✅ Yes (if allowed by SMTP provider)
Let me know which SMTP provider you're using (Gmail, SendGrid, Mailgun, etc.) and I’ll give you more specific advice!
